Description: A showcase of Bayesian clinical trial designs, implemented in 
    'RStan' and R. Some designs are implemented in R for the first
    time (e.g. EffTox). Given the emphasis on flexibility in Bayesian analysis,
    the implementations in a common language and style may serve as a cookbook
    to encourage the use of Bayesian methods in trials. Compiled 'RStan' models
    are provided in addition to helper functions to perform simulations and
    inference on observed trial outcomes. There is a preponderance of early
    phase trial designs because this is where Bayesian methods are used most.
    If there is a published Bayesian design you want implemented in Stan, get in
    touch.
