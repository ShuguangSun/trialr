Description: Implementation of Bayesian clinical trial designs in R and RStan.
    Functions are provided to perform simulations and invoke designs on
    observed trial outcomes. There is a preponderance of early-phase trial
    designs because this is where the Bayesian methodology is used most.
    If there is a published Bayesian design you want implemented in Stan,
    get in touch.
