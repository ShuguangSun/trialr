Hopefully this NOTE is safe to ignore.

  installed size is  8.1Mb
  sub-directories of 1Mb or more:
    libs   6.5Mb
  
  The package contains compiled RStan models, hence the directory size.
  This note was also present in previous CRAN versions.

Furthermore, I am aware of an issue with rstan 2.18 / C++14 (and thus, this package too) on Solaris.
Corresponding with the rstan maintainer, I gather a solution has been proposed but perhaps not yet accepted.
