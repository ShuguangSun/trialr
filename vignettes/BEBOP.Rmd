# Introducing the BEBOP design
The BEBOP trial methodology was developed for the PePS2 trial to study co-primary efficacy and toxicity outcomes using pembrolizumab in non-small-cell lung cancer patients with performance status 2.
BEBOP stands for Bayesian Evaluation of Bivariate Binary Outcomes and Predictive Information.
A major factor in the PePS2 trial is the availability of the PD-L1 tumour proportion score biomarker introduced by @Garon2015.

BEBOP re-uses the probability model at the core of the EffTox design [@Thall2004].
Let $x$ represent a vector of predictive baseline variables and $\theta$ a vector of parameters.
