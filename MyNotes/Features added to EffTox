The implementation of EffTox in trialr provides:

- the first implementation of EffTox in R;
- the ability to run EffTox on non-Windows machines
- a script approach, as opposed to menus-and-buttons approach, which is useful for automation, saving, sharing, source control, etc;
- access to posterior utility samples, for plotting etc;
- the dose-superiority matrix (not presented by Thall et al.);
- ability to use variable cohort sizes in simulation;
- ability to simulate culmination of trial from partially observed state;
- Users can control level of precision in posterior sampling via Stan args;
- an open-source implementation from which adaptation is relatively simple.
